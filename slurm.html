  <h1>The storage structure </h1>
  <p>At TSL we have a large, shared storage device. We put all of our working data here.
      Because its shared we have to take care of it and have a
      defined structure and a few rules about how and where you store stuff.</p>
    <p>There are four main areas</p>
    <h3>/solexa</h3>
    <p>/solexa is the place where the data generated on the TSL Illumina machine gets put when it is generated.
         This is raw, unprocessed sequence data fresh off the machine. You’ll never need to (or be allowed to)
          write to this directory. But you will be able to pull the data you need out of it. Older runs get ‘distilled’ which means some of the accessory
        run files and non-essential files are removed to save space.</p>
    <h3>/home/programs</h3>
    <p>/home/programs is where we put our shared programs, you will be able to put whatever you like in here, its
         completely read-able and writeable by all. If you aren’t comfortable installing
        your own software come and ask the Bioinformatics team and we’ll install stuff for you.</p>
    <h3>/home/your_user_name</h3>
    <p>This area is your reserved user space. You can do whatever you like here. You have full read and write access. There is a size limit
         but its quite generous and if you really need more come and ask and we can extend it for you.</p>
    <h3>/home/data</h3>
    <p>We put shared ‘finished’ and commonly used data sets here. Because this is stuff that we wan’t to be able to keep
        track of then we require that you describe your data in a brief way in the included README.txt file. Anything that appears in
         this directory but not in the README.txt file will be singled out for deletion.</p>
    <p>This folder is a great place to find any commonly used data files, say you need the Arabidopsis genome sequence. Don’t download yet another copy,
         look through here and you’ll find it. Here’s a rundown of the structure.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="http://tsltraining.tsl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/figure_2b.png" alt="data storage structure"/>
    <p>Hopefully this is enough to get you going with how we organise our data, but as ever, if you have any questions, just ask</p>
